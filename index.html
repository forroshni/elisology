      <h2>Our first Monthsary!</h2>
      <p class="intro">Cheers  to our first month together. Lots of ups and downs but ultimately, I can safely say that it was  one of the  best months of my life (Ama Kassam). So many things have already happened that it's crazy to think that it's only been 30 days because it genuinely feels like I've known you since forever.</p>

        <h3>Destiny</h3>
        <p>The way we met and fell in love is so absurd and impossible that it has to be destiny or divine intervention. Like someone put us on this path to be together with each other and I'm fairly certain that that it was your grandfather, your baboi and my jiji. Let's not let him down and get officialy married someday (cause we're unofficialy married already).</p>

        <h3>Friends and Enemies</h3>
        <p>At first it was just you fighting for me, all alone with everyone telling you that I'm not the right person for you. And over time, your close friends are my friends as well and now half the world is fighting for us. If that isn't a sign that we're meant to be then I don't know what is.</p>

        <h3>Hotel Collection O</h3>
        <p>So many of our first memories together lie in Hotel Collection O that it now feels somewhat like home, doesn't it? Ahahahahaha. Our first kiss, first night together, first time you confessed to me. Even the day our relationship began is set because of the memories we made that day in that very hotel. We'll keep going there more and more, ehe.</p>

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>Craziest thing about our relationship is that we have forever to go. Just this month has been so utterly full of colours and memories so imagine how thrilling our entire life will be. It's going to be one hell of a ride so strap on and let's jump in together forever.</p>
