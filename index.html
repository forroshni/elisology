        <p>I've been here for years and years and years and years, but I never felt the way I do whenever you're with me. You talk to me, you care for me and you love me. You're the only one I can talk to as openly as I do, I can be myself with you. Ou, I love you hau.</p>

        <p>Fuck this place. Mann nai pardaina yo majitar, yo smit. 6 years I spent in this place and everyday, I felt like I'm in hell. Till now, I feel like I'm on the worst place on Earth, but now that you're here, I feel like my life here is better. Prabhu lai mailey j mangey ni, timiley ayera deu malai. Thank you so much.</p>
