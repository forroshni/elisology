      <p class="intro">Cheers to us spending Valentines day together. Someday, I'll come take you away and when I do, no one will stop me. Not Sumiran, Not Raju and not Deepak. And even if I can't make you mine in this life, I'll definitely make you mine in the next. </p>

        <h3>Friends and Enemies</h3>
        <p>At first it was just you fighting for me, all alone with everyone telling you that I'm not the right person for you. And over time, your close friends are my friends as well and now half the world is fighting for us. If that isn't a sign that we're meant to be then I don't know what is.</p>

        <h3>Hotel Collection O</h3>
        <p>So many of our first memories together lie in Hotel Collection O that it now feels somewhat like home, doesn't it? Ahahahahaha. Our first kiss, first night together, first time you confessed to me. Even the day our relationship began is set because of the memories we made that day in that very hotel. We'll keep going there more and more, ehe.</p>

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>Craziest thing about our relationship is that we have forever to go. Just this month has been so utterly full of colours and memories so imagine how thrilling our entire life will be. It's going to be one hell of a ride so strap on and let's jump in together forever.</p>
